Issues
	Directory Double Check
		OK, as is, would be nice to get rid the double check, though
		Why the double hit?
			first is check the amount owned by 'me'
			second is all files on server
		Why 0 the first time?
			0 is the amount owned by 'me'
		Can it be optimized?
			??
				The first is there to remove abandoned files
				Probably need to investigate / test more
